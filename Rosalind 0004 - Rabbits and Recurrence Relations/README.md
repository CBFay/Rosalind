# Rabbits and Recurrence Relations

## Problem

In 1202, Leonardo of Pisa (commonly known as Fibonacci) considered a mathematical exercise regarding the reproduction of a population of rabbits. He made the following simplifying assumptions about the population:

1) The population begins in the first month with a pair of newborn rabbits.  
2) Rabbits reach reproductive age after one month.  
3) In any given month, every rabbit of reproductive age mates with another rabbit of reproductive age.  
4) Exactly one month after two rabbits mate, they produce one male and one female rabbit.  
5) Rabbits never die or stop reproducing.  

Given: Positive integers n≤40 and k≤5.

Return: The total number of rabbit pairs that will be present after nn months, if we begin with 1 pair and in each generation, every pair of reproduction-age rabbits produces a litter of kk rabbit pairs (instead of only 1 pair).
